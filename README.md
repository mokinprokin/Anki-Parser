An asynchronous **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that connects AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, LM Studio, etc.) directly to your local **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)** flashcard collection via [AnkiConnect](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect).

Turn any LLM into an autonomous language tutor, note organizer, and flashcard manager that inspects your decks, prevents duplicates, formats vocabulary, and writes cards without leaving your chat or IDE.

## ⚡ Highlights

- **Full AnkiConnect Integration:** Create, update, tag, and delete notes, inspect decks, read study cards, and trigger AnkiWeb synchronization.
- **Built for AI Agents:** Includes a battle-tested [`instruction.md`](instruction.md) prompt for seamless zero-friction vocabulary workflows.
- **Strict Pydantic Validation:** All inputs and domain models are validated against strict Pydantic schemas.
- **Zero-Setup Execution with `uvx`:** Run directly from GitHub without cloning or managing virtual environments manually.
- **Safe Network Layer:** Custom async HTTP transport powered by `aiohttp` with built-in retry mechanisms and connection-drop guards.

## 🧠 Recommended Agent Instructions

This server is designed to work in synergy with autonomous AI agents. 

We provide a comprehensive, production-ready system prompt file:
👉 **[instruction.md](instruction.md)**

It instructs the model how to:
1. Automatically differentiate between single words, synonym clusters, and idioms.
2. Validate existing notes before adding to prevent duplicates.
3. Generate phonetics (IPA), parts of speech, and natural cloze/context examples.
4. Call tools autonomously without asking for confirmation every turn.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

1. **Anki Desktop:** Install and keep Anki running on your computer.
2. **AnkiConnect Addon:** 
   - Open Anki $\rightarrow$ *Tools* $\rightarrow$ *Add-ons* $\rightarrow$ *Get Add-ons...*
   - Enter code: `2055492159`
   - Restart Anki. AnkiConnect runs locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.
3. **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):** The fast Python package manager.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run the server either directly from GitHub using `uvx` (recommended) or from a local clone.

### Option 1: Direct Run from GitHub (Zero Installation)

Add the following to your MCP client configuration (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json` or Cline):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anki-github": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/mokinprokin/Anki-MCP.git",
        "anki_mcp_server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Option 2: Local Development

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/mokinprokin/Anki-MCP.git
    cd Anki-MCP

2.  Install dependencies with uv:

    uv sync

3.  Configure your MCP client using local paths:
```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "anki-agent": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
            "--directory",
            "C:/path/to/Anki-MCP",
            "run",
            "anki_mcp_server"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
```
